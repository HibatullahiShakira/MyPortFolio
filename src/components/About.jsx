                <p>
                    I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Software Engineer with a solid grounding in Economics
                    and quantitative analysis. My career spans across help contributing to building Nigeria’s first open-source multilingual LLM,
                    deploying ASR/TTS services at scale, and architecting production ML pipelines for fintech and risk models.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I specialize in end-to-end systems—from data collection and preprocessing through model training,
                    inference APIs and cloud deployment. I enjoy working at the intersection of research and engineering,
                    translating complex algorithms into reliable, maintainable software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work I mentor aspiring engineers, contribute to open-source language models, and keep up
                    with advancements in ML/AI. I am interested in senior roles where I can lead projects and mentor teams.
